# ⚙️ Welcome to DCP Labs 🚀

<br>

Welcome to **DCP Labs** – a space where we experiment, build, and share tools for the **DevOps Control Plane (DCP)**.

Our mission is simple:

* 🛠️ Automate everything
* ☁️ Simplify cloud operations (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* ⎈ Orchestrate with Kubernetes and Docker
* 🔄 Build reliable CI/CD pipelines
* 📜 Share scripts, infra code, and best practices

Whether you’re here to explore **bash/python scripts**, **infrastructure as code**, **Kubernetes manifests**, or **CI/CD pipelines**, you’ll find building blocks to help you **learn, experiment, and scale**.

🚀 **DCP Labs = Innovating. Automating. Scaling.**

### **Commit Message Guide**

We follow a simple format for commit messages:

```
<tool>: <work description>
```

**Rules:**

1. Start with a tool prefix (see list below).
2. Use **past tense verbs** like *added, created, modified, updated, removed, fixed*.
3. Keep it short and descriptive (ideally under 50 characters).
4. Avoid vague messages like *fixed stuff* or *updated code*.
5. Each commit should represent one logical change.

**Allowed Tool Prefixes:**

* `scripts` → Bash, Python, PowerShell scripts
* `docker` → Dockerfiles
* `docker-compose` → Docker Compose configs
* `k8s` → Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts
* `jenkins` → Jenkins pipelines
* `ci` → CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
* `aws` → AWS infrastructure (Terraform, CloudFormation)
* `azure` → Azure infrastructure (Terraform, Bicep)
* `gcp` → GCP infrastructure (Terraform, Deployment Manager)
* `infra` → Terraform, Ansible, Packer changes
* `docs` → Documentation updates
* `tests` → Test cases and frameworks

**Examples:**

* `scripts: added bash script for log rotation`
* `docker: fixed multi-stage build error`
* `docker-compose: updated volumes config`
* `k8s: created deployment with liveness probe`
* `jenkins: added pipeline for Terraform validation`
* `aws: created VPC module for networking`
* `docs: updated repo structure in README`
* `tests: added unit tests for python scripts`
